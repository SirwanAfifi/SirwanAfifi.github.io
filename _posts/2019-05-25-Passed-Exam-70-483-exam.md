# Resources

These are the books I used for passing the exam.

- [Exam Ref 70-483 Programming in C#, 2nd Edition By Rob Miles](https://www.amazon.com/Exam-Ref-70-483-Programming-Miles/dp/1509306986)
- [C# 6.0 in a Nutshell: The Definitive Reference](https://www.amazon.com/C-6-0-Nutshell-Definitive-Reference/dp/1491927062/ref=sr_1_4?crid=218XJSHWO1SYD&keywords=c+in+a+nutshell&qid=1560670921&s=books&sprefix=C%23+in+a+%2Cstripbooks-intl-ship%2C380&sr=1-4)

The way I read these books was by reading them from cover to cover and highlight important things:

I also kept track of the notes somewhere else to review them after finishing the books:
