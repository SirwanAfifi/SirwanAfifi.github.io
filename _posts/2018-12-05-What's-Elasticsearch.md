Wikipedia:

> Elasticsearch is a search engine based on the Lucene library. It provides a distributed, multitenant-capable full-text search engine with an HTTP web interface and schema-free JSON documents. Elasticsearch is developed in Java and is released as open source under the terms of the Apache License. Official clients are available in Java, .NET (C#), PHP, Python, Apache Groovy, Ruby and many other languages.5 According to the DB-Engines ranking, Elasticsearch is the most popular enterprise search engine followed by Apache Solr, also based on Lucene.

Executing SELECT \* FROM .... all the time consumes a lot of CPU also it doesn't have index, One solution would be using FTS (Full Text Search) in RDBMS but in NoSQL world If you need a high performance search engine you'd better use Elasticsearch.

### History

- 1999 - Lucene
  - It helped all search engines back then index the data that they were adjusting from the internet and provide reasonable ways of retrieving that information based fuzzy matching.
- 2004 - Compass
  - Built on top of Lucene, the same services but in a more scalable manner, idea was to provide a distributed search solution.
- 2010 - Elasticsearch
  - Distributed, RESTful search and analytical engine

### Use cases

- Security/log analytics
- Marketing = Use this data to find things:
  - How people find our website?
  - Where they came from?
  - What device they are using?
  - What part of the world they are coming from?
- Search = ES was built with idea of great search engine

### Concepts

- Near Real Time (NRT)
- Cluster:
  - collection of our nodes
  - has a unique name
- Node:
  - part of the cluster to store the data
  - has a unique name
- Index:
  - a collection of similar documents
- Type:
  - a category or a partition of your index
- Document:
  - in JSON format
  - customer
  - event

### Querying

- Simple query:
  - get all accounts: GET bank/account/\_search
  - get all accounts in state of CA:
  ```js
  GET bank/account/_search
  {
      "query": {
          "match": {
              "state": "CA"
          }
      }
  }
  ```
  -Â multiple conditions:
  ```js
  GET bank/account/_search
  {
      "query": {
          "bool": {
              "state": "CA"
          }
      }
  }
  ```
  - boost: 3 = three times more important than state
  - `_score`: How ES identifies the relevance of a document based on your search query

### Bulk loading data into Elasticsearch

\_bulk: The endpoint for bulk api, this is where we send request to when we want to bulk load data. it expects new-line delimited JSON data (including a new-line at the very end, which is important, otherwise we'll get errors). It allows us to `Index`, `Create`, `Delete`, `Update`. When using this we need to make sure we are using `--data-binary` flag from the curl command.

- /\_bulk
- new-line JSON
- Index, Create, Delete, Update
- --data-binary

#### How to bulk load data

- Create a file that has some data in it:

```js
{ "index" : { "_index" : "indexName", "_type" : "typeName", "_id": "1" }}
{"title":"Web Developer II","author":"Chrysler Clerk","content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit. Proin risus. Praesent lectus.","publishedDate":"2018-02-03T17:51:14Z"}
```

- Load the data into Elasticsearch using curl:

```js
curl -s -H "Content-Type: application/x-ndjson" -XPOST localhost:9200/_bulk --data-binary "@reqs"; echo
```
