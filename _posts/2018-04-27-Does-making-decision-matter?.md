We make decision all the time, most of these decisions are done unconsciously, others we agonize over, we all have been there agonizing over a difficult or big decision, we always worry about what to do next, in fact we are trying to make the right decision, But in my opinion there’s no such thing as the right thing or the wrong thing, it’s been a big deal for me because making decisions (big and little ones) have been challenging in my life.

Last Friday I was talking with a friend ([Foad](http://foad-ansari.ir/)) about making decisions, he told me about something called Decidophobia or simply fear of making decisions.

Life is full of options and choices so don’t waste your time to worry about right and wrong decisions JUST take action it’s worth it.
