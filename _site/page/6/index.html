        Delegates in C#
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">02 Jul 2016</span>

    <p>Lately I have been studying some topics in C# in order to improve myself. I think <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms173171.aspx">Delegate</a> is one of those topics which is kinda difficult for beginners to initiate with. So, in order to make it clear how it works, I’m going to make some explanations in this post.</p>

<h3 id="what-are-delegates">What are Delegates?</h3>
<p>Delegate was introduced in C# 1. Think of it as a simply being a placeholder for functions that’ll be called at some point in time. Assume you want to declare a variable that is a reference to a specific method. In this case, the variable encapsulates some executable code and you can invoke the variable just like an actual method. In doing so, we need to create a delegate</p>

<h3 id="defining-a-delegate">Defining a Delegate</h3>
<p>Delegates are created using <code class="highlighter-rouge">delegate</code> keyword along with the function signature:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp"><span class="k">delegate</span> <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="nf">Sum</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="p">);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>As you can see we are defining a delegate called <code class="highlighter-rouge">Sum</code> that is compatible with any method with an <code class="highlighter-rouge">int</code> return type with two parameters. Actually we defined a type that we can use to create variables and point those variables to methods that have the same signature and same return type. 
The type defenition for a delegate describes the method that we want to call:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp"><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="nf">Add</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">=&gt;</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="p">+</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="p">;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Now we can assign a method to the delegate variable. This assignment creates a delegate instance:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp"><span class="n">Sum</span> <span class="n">s</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="n">Add</span><span class="p">;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Now we can invoke the delegate instance in the same way as a method:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp"><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">result</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="nf">s</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="m">5</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">6</span><span class="p">);</span></code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="advantages-of-delegate">Advantages of Delegate</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Delegates are type safe, It means that the C# compiler checks the function signatures of a Delegate when you use them at runtime.</li>
  <li>Can be used to define callback functions.</li>
  <li>Can be dynamically switched at runtime.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="real-world-example">Real World example</h3>
<p>Suppose that you want to implement something like a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.ui.webcontrols.repeater(v=vs.85).aspx">Repeater</a> control in your ASP.NET MVC application, As you probably know a Repeater is(was) server side databound control in ASP.NET WebForm for displaying information, It had a lot of flexability becuase you had complete control over the your markup.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp"><span class="k">public</span> <span class="k">static</span> <span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Helpers</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
	<span class="k">public</span> <span class="k">delegate</span> <span class="n">HelperResult</span> <span class="n">ItemTemplate</span><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="n">T</span><span class="p">&gt;(</span><span class="n">T</span> <span class="n">input</span><span class="p">);</span>

	  <span class="n">ItemTemplate</span><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="n">T</span><span class="p">&gt;</span> <span class="n">itemTemplate</span><span class="p">,</span>
	  <span class="n">ItemTemplate</span><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="n">T</span><span class="p">&gt;</span> <span class="n">alternatingitemTemplate</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="k">null</span><span class="p">)</span>
	<span class="p">{</span>
		<span class="k">return</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nf">HelperResult</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">writer</span> <span class="p">=&gt;</span>
		<span class="p">{</span>
			<span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="m">0</span><span class="p">;</span>
			<span class="k">foreach</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">var</span> <span class="n">item</span> <span class="k">in</span> <span class="n">items</span><span class="p">)</span>
			<span class="p">{</span>
				<span class="kt">var</span> <span class="n">func</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="p">%</span> <span class="m">2</span> <span class="p">==</span> <span class="m">0</span> <span class="p">?</span> <span class="n">itemTemplate</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">alternatingitemTemplate</span><span class="p">;</span>
				<span class="nf">func</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">item</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nf">WriteTo</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">writer</span><span class="p">);</span>
				<span class="n">i</span><span class="p">++;</span>
			<span class="p">}</span>
		<span class="p">});</span>
	<span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>As you can see we emulated the <code class="highlighter-rouge">ItemTemplate</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">AlternatingItemTemplate</code> using a delegate. In this case user can pass the data and the data will be rendered inside the view. In this case the delegates act like callback. <br />
The <code class="highlighter-rouge">ItemTemplate</code> delegate in our example can be replaced with <code class="highlighter-rouge">Func</code> delegate:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp"><span class="n">Func</span><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="n">T</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">HelperResult</span><span class="p">&gt;</span> <span class="n">itemTemplate</span><span class="p">,</span>
<span class="n">Func</span><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="n">T</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">HelperResult</span><span class="p">&gt;</span> <span class="n">alternatingitemTemplate</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="k">null</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Now we can use our helper inside any view:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"><span class="nt">&lt;table&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;tr&gt;</span>
        <span class="nt">&lt;td&gt;</span>Id<span class="nt">&lt;/td&gt;</span>
        <span class="nt">&lt;td&gt;</span>Name<span class="nt">&lt;/td&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;/tr&gt;</span>
    @Html.Repeater(Model, @<span class="nt">&lt;tr&gt;</span>
	    <span class="nt">&lt;td&gt;</span>@item.Title<span class="nt">&lt;/td&gt;</span>
	    <span class="nt">&lt;td&gt;</span>@item.Price<span class="nt">&lt;/td&gt;</span>
	<span class="nt">&lt;/tr&gt;</span>, 
	@<span class="nt">&lt;tr</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">"alert-info"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
	    <span class="nt">&lt;td&gt;</span>@item.Title<span class="nt">&lt;/td&gt;</span>
	    <span class="nt">&lt;td&gt;</span>@item.Price<span class="nt">&lt;/td&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;/tr&gt;</span>)
<span class="nt">&lt;/table&gt;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>If you run the application you can see the result:</p>

<p>Today I was talking with a friend of mine about thinking, The topic is interesting and I wanted to share it with you because as a programmer we are always thinking and trying to find solutions. Actually it’s a good habit when you want to learn something new, instead of taking action and delve into the details, you should think about that and break it down into several pieces then construct it as a big picture. Once you get familiar to it you can start trying to figure out each individual piece, By doing so you will become great in your field.</p>

<p>On the other hand, thinking isn’t the only thing for being an expert in programming. Suppose that you are given a challenging feature to implement in a team you’re working with, you might spend days and days trying to implement this feature and each time you fail and stuck in it then you try to find a solution on the net or asking questions on Stackoverflow. I’m not saying you shouldn’t google about your problem, What I’m saying is that you should understand the problem, This is where a Thinking out of the box’s metaphor comes into play.</p>

<p>This is very helpful because when you ran into a problem you should first think about it in a new or a different prespective, For example you can put yourself in end user’s place and try to figure it out. Once you understand it, you can start coding the feature. By doing so you can help yourself and believe me it works like a charm and you don’t need to post off-topic questions every single day on Stackoverflow anymore, Instead when you run into a serious problem, you can post your question and get extra votes :)</p>

<p>So thinking out of the box helps us to think like a programmer, It also helps you to approach problems in new ways.</p>

        Why AngularJS?
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">17 Apr 2016</span>

    <p>I wanted to share a few thoughts about AngularJS</p>

<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>AngularJS is a MV* framework for writing manageable, clean, full-featured applications in the browser with JavaScript , It’s also incredibly easy to learn for those who already have HTML and JavaScript experience. Angular’s goal was to create a way for designers to be able to do HTML design using components. One thing that I like about Angular is that, it’s an opinionated MV* framework, It means that it tells you what are the certain ways of doing things, Some people might argue that it’s somehow a limitation for a framework such as Angular because it solves fewer problems, but I think at least it assures to not having spaghetti code.</p>

<h3 id="how-i-got-into-angularjs">How I got into AngularJS</h3>
<p>I have been sitting on the fence for far too long to chose a great JavaScript framework. Finally a couple of years ago I decided to use AngularJS and it caught my attention. It actually made me cursious to learn more about it. I started to use AngularJS for some parts of my application. At the time Angular team were working on the next version of the framework So I stopped using it because I heard that the next version is a different framework. Now I have come to conclusion that it’s better to stick with Angular 1.x, then I can switch to Angular 2 in a right time.</p>

<h3 id="angularjs-benefites">AngularJS Benefites</h3>
<p>Angular has lots of great features from testability and two-way binding, to more vague concepts. For me the best thing about Angular is that it has a flat learning curve So you can get the most of it. All being said here are the some of my favorite features and benefits of Angular:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Code Reduction: Angular reduces the amount of code that developers write.</li>
  <li>Two Way Binding</li>
  <li>Beautiful syntax and higher level APIs</li>
</ul>

<p>For example take a look this piece of code written in raw JavaScript:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span class="nb">document</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">getElementById</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'btn'</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">addEventListener</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'click'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">el</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nx">alert</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'clicked!'</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">});</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Whereas with Angular you can simple achieve same goal this way:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nx">button</span> <span class="nx">id</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">"btn"</span> <span class="nx">ng</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="nx">click</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">"handleClick()"</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="nx">Click</span> <span class="nx">Me</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="sr">/button</span><span class="err">&gt;
</span>
<span class="nx">$scope</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">handleClick</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nx">console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'clicked!'</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>As you can see the Angular code is less complex.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Popularity</li>
  <li>Testability<br />
Angular was designed with testing in mind. So you can test any components of your application easily through both <a href="https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/unit-testing">unit testing</a> and <a href="https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/e2e-testing">end to end</a> testing. For unit testing you can use a component called <a href="https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ngMock">ngMock</a> and for e2e testing you can use <a href="https://github.com/angular/protractor">Protractor</a>. It is worthwhile to mention that for both cases you can run your tests using a tool called Karma.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="angularjs-gotchas">AngularJS gotchas</h3>
<p>Although Angular is a great framework but it has some problems that you can run into trouble with it. Here are some of them:</p>

<ul>
  <li>SEO<br />
For dealing with this issue we can use server side rendering or use a <a href="https://prerender.io/">prerenderer</a>,</li>
  <li>Performance<br />
One thing that causes performance problem in Angular is having too many bindings. If performance is important you can consider using a different rendering engine.</li>
  <li>External Events and Digest Cycle</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Even though Angular 2 is coming, But Angular 1 is still a thing and I think Angular 1 will be supported for a long time to come.</p>
